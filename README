  To simply run the SDES, compile and run run_SDES.cpp.
In linux do this:
g++ run_SDES.cpp -o run -std=c++11
./run



I added make file you can see "makes" by typing make -f makefile.mak
and run:
./client
./server in a different terminal window so that you can see connection while establishing.
then use commands for client to send actions to server side.


In windows you can open it with your favourite c++ IDE and compile and run.

To see the client-server in action, do this in linux:
make -f makefile.mak
You will see all the .cpp files compiled with no warnings.
Now run Server with a tcp port no.:
​./server 7000​
​Run Client/s in other terminal/s like this:
./client
Usage of client commands will be shown on terminal.
